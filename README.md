# Running Planner 

## Overview 

A personal project that allows you to plan runs ahead of time, track goals, and view monthly recaps. 

My motivation for wanting to work on this idea was because I wanted to build a tool that I myself & my running friends can use. I wanted to play with the Strava API and integrate some of the Strava premium features like goal setting into my app. 

## Features
- Create, edit, and archive training programs
- Set weekly distance goals & see progress towards your goals
- Create, edit, delete running eventes on program calendar
- Set individual distance goal by day 
- View monthly recaps (fastest run, longest run, average pace, total monthly distance)
- View recent activities and their routes 

## Tech Stack 
- React JS, React Router
- Styled Components, MUI 
- API (Mapbox, Strava)
